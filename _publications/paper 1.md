Primary school students, despite their vulnerability to cyberattacks, lack targeted cybersecurity education. Using Scopus and Google Scholar, this scoping review analyzed 15 articles (2014–2024) following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines to examine the landscape of cybersecurity education for this age group. Four key themes emerged: educational tools and methods, theoretical perspectives on online risks, parental engagement, and children's online behaviors and risks. Findings revealed that while students possess some awareness, their understanding is often superficial, leading to overconfidence and risky online practices. A disconnect was observed between parents and teachers regarding responsibility and effective safety practices. Furthermore, limited implementation and outdated resources hinder the effectiveness of promising pedagogical approaches such as digital games and interactive platforms. This review highlights the urgent need for comprehensive cybersecurity education fostering critical thinking and stakeholder collaboration. It provides practical implications for educators, parents, and policymakers to promote a culture of online safety alongside recommendations for future research.
