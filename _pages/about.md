Nice to meet you! My name is Grace, and I'm currently a master's student in the Learning Design and Technology program at Stanford University. My current interests are Elementary Education, Learning Sciences, Educational Technology, Design-based Research, and Computational Thinking. I will be starting my PhD in the Curriculum, Instruction, and Science of Learning program at the University at Buffalo in Fall 2025.
